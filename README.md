# Project-----Home-price-prediction-using-ML-algorithm

Objective - To predict the home price based on different home features

- Performed Data pre-processing (data loading and cleaning, outlier removal, feature engineering, dimensionality
reduction, visualization & making the Data ready for model training, using pandas, matplotlib, one-hot-encoding).
Experimented selected Regression algorithms, Linear reg, Lasso, SVR, RF, KNR, B.Ridge, DT using Sklearn, and
evaluated the best performing algorithm and parameters using gridsearchCV, best-score: 0.85 on cross-validation.
Developed the model with the best-scoring algorithm, predicted some test-samples & saved the model using pickle.
