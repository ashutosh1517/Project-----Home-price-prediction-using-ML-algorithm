# Project-----Price prediction using Ensemble model - Regression, Machine Learning

Objective - To predict the home price based on input home features

â€“ Performed Data pre-processing (data loading and cleaning, outlier removal, feature engineering, dimensionality
reduction, visualization & making the Data ready for model training, using pandas, matplotlib, one-hot-encoding).
Applied different algorithms, Linear regression, Lasso (regularization), SVR, RF, Decision Tree using Scikitlearn,
and evaluated the best-performing algorithm and parameters using gridsearchCV, then applied Ensemble Learning.
Achieved 85.5% accuracy. Developed the final model with the Ensemble learning, predicted some test-samples &
saved the model using pickle.
